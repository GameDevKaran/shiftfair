# Hosting scope — 18 October 2026

Only Google Cloud project tough-melody-508008-p8 (google-hackathon) is authorized for supporting hosting. Region us-central1 is preferred; planned service name shiftfair. Project access and billing enabled status are verified. This does not authorize new paid charges. No service, identity, secret or data store for ShiftFair has been created.

Use explicit project/region flags. Preserve existing services audiencegraph-web, greenlight and production-control-0909-01a085, their data and identities. Use this application's own identity, secrets and data; never borrow Greenlight's database or existing build buckets. No new cloud project, Cloud SQL, Firebase Authentication or purchased domain is needed by default.

Prefer static delivery with local-first data and exports. No backend database, login or runtime model is needed. Hosting access/cost must be verified before publishing.

The portfolio runbook and exact resource allocation are in core-research/configuration/GCP_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md and gcp-service-allocation.json. Recheck names and record commit/image/URL/rollback before deployment. Build/test locally while access or spending gates remain.
